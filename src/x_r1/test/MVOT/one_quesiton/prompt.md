**Question**
What are all values of $p$ such that for every $q>0$, we have $$\frac{3(pq^2+p^2q+3q^2+3pq)}{p+q}>2p^2q?$$ Express your answer in interval notation in decimal form.
**Answer**
*Step 1*
<think> First we'll simplify that complicated expression. We attempt to factor the numerator of the left side: \begin{align*} pq^2+p^2q+3q^2+3pq &= q(pq + p^2 + 3q + 3p) \\ &= q[ p(q+p) + 3(q+p) ] \\ &= q(p+3)(q+p). \end{align*} </think>
<answer> Numerator of the left side: $q(p+3)(q+p)$ </answer>
*Step 2*
<think> Substituting this in for the numerator in our inequality gives $$\frac{3q(p+3)(p+q)}{p+q}>2p^2q.$$We note that left hand side has $p+q$ in both the numerator and denominator. We can only cancel these terms if $p+q \neq 0.$ Since we're looking for values of $p$ such that the inequality is true for all $q > 0,$ we need $p \geq 0$ so that $p + q \neq 0.$
<answer> We can derive $p \geq 0$ </answer>
*Step 3*
<think> Also because this must be true for every $q>0$, we can cancel the $q$'s on both sides. This gives \begin{align*} 3(p+3)&>2p^2\Rightarrow\\ 3p+9&>2p^2 \Rightarrow\\ 0&>2p^2-3p-9. \end{align*} </think>
<answer> The inequality can be simplified to $2p^2-3p-9<0$ </answer>
*Step 4*
<think> Now we must solve this quadratic inequality. We can factor the quadratic as $2p^2-3p-9=(2p+3)(p-3)$. The roots are $p=3$ and $p=-1.5$. Since a graph of this parabola would open upwards, we know that the value of $2p^2 - 3p - 9$ is negative between the roots, so the solution to our inequality is $-1.5<p<3.$ But we still need $0 \leq p,$ so in interval notation the answer is $\boxed{[0,3)}$.</think>
<answer> The final answer is $\boxed{[0,3)}$ </answer>
