To find the minimum possible value of \((a+b+c+d)^2 + (e+f+g+h)^2\) where \(a, b, c, d, e, f, g, h\) are distinct elements from the set \(\{-7, -5, -3, -2, 2, 4, 6, 13\}\), we need to consider how to balance the sums of two subsets as closely as possible.

First, calculate the sum of all elements in the set:
\[
-7 + (-5) + (-3) + (-2) + 2 + 4 + 6 + 13 = 8.
\]
We want to split these elements into two groups such that the sums of the elements in each group are as close to each other as possible. Let's denote the sum of the elements in one group as \(S_1\) and the sum of the elements in the other group as \(S_2\). Since \(S_1 + S_2 = 8\), we want \(S_1\) and \(S_2\) to be as close to \(4\) as possible.

Let's try different partitions and calculate the sums:

1. Group 1: \(-7, -5, 6, 13\)
   \[
   -7 + (-5) + 6 + 13 = 7.
   \]
   Group 2: \(-3, -2, 2, 4\)
   \[
   -3 + (-2) + 2 + 4 = 1.
   \]
   Then, \((7)^2 + (1)^2 = 49 + 1 = 50\).

2. Group 1: \(-7, -3, 4, 13\)
   \[
   -7 + (-3) + 4 + 13 = 7.
   \]
   Group 2: \(-5, -2, 2, 6\)
   \[
   -5 + (-2) + 2 + 6 = 1.
   \]
   Then, \((7)^2 + (1)^2 = 49 + 1 = 50\).

3. Group 1: \(-7, -2, 4, 13\)
   \[
   -7 + (-2) + 4 + 13 = 8.
   \]
   Group 2: \(-5, -3, 2, 6\)
   \[
   -5 + (-3) + 2 + 6 = 0.
   \]
   Then, \((8)^2 + (0)^2 = 64 + 0 = 64\).

4. Group 1: \(-7, -5, 2, 13\)
   \[
   -7 + (-5) + 2 + 13 = 3.
   \]
   Group 2: \(-3, -2, 4, 6\)
   \[
   -3 + (-2) + 4 + 6 = 5.
   \]
   Then, \((3)^2 + (5)^2 = 9 + 25 = 34\).

5. Group 1: \(-7, -3, 6, 13\)
   \[
   -7 + (-3) + 6 + 13 = 9.
   \]
   Group 2: \(-5, -2, 2, 4\)
   \[
   -5 + (-2) + 2 + 4 = 1.
   \]
   Then, \((9)^2 + (1)^2 = 81 + 1 = 82\).

From the above calculations, the minimum value is obtained when the sums of the two groups are 3 and 5, giving us a total of \(34\).

Thus, the minimum possible value of \((a+b+c+d)^2 + (e+f+g+h)^2\) is \(\boxed{34}\).
