To find the minimum possible value of \((a+b+c+d)^2 + (e+f+g+h)^2\) where \(a, b, c, d, e, f, g, h\) are distinct elements in the set \(\{-7, -5, -3, -2, 2, 4, 6, 13\}\), we start by noting that the sum of all the elements in the set is:
\[
-7 + (-5) + (-3) + (-2) + 2 + 4 + 6 + 13 = 8.
\]
Let \(S_1 = a + b + c + d\) and \(S_2 = e + f + g + h\). Since \(a, b, c, d, e, f, g, h\) are distinct elements in the set, we have \(S_1 + S_2 = 8\). We need to minimize \(S_1^2 + S_2^2\). Using the identity \(S_1^2 + S_2^2 = S_1^2 + (8 - S_1)^2\), we get:
\[
S_1^2 + S_2^2 = S_1^2 + (8 - S_1)^2 = S_1^2 + 64 - 16S_1 + S_1^2 = 2S_1^2 - 16S_1 + 64.
\]
This is a quadratic function in terms of \(S_1\) and it is minimized when \(S_1 = \frac{-(-16)}{2 \cdot 2} = 4\). Thus, \(S_2 = 8 - S_1 = 4\). We need to check if it is possible to partition the set into two groups of four elements each, such that the sum of each group is 4.
One possible partition is \(\{-7, 6, 4, 1\}\) and \(\{-5, -3, -2, 13\}\):
\[
-7 + 6 + 4 + 1 = 4 \quad \text{and} \quad -5 + (-3) + (-2) + 13 = 4.
\]
Therefore, the minimum possible value of \((a+b+c+d)^2 + (e+f+g+h)^2\) is:
\[
4^2 + 4^2 = 16 + 16 = 32.
\]
Thus, the answer is:
\[
\boxed{32}.
\]
