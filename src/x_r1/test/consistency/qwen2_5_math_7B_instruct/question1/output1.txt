To find the minimum possible value of \((a+b+c+d)^2 + (e+f+g+h)^2\), we start by calculating the sum of all elements in the set \(\{-7, -5, -3, -2, 2, 4, 6, 13\}\):

\[
-7 + (-5) + (-3) + (-2) + 2 + 4 + 6 + 13 = 8.
\]

Since the sum of all elements is 8, if we partition the set into two groups, the sums of the elements in the two groups must add up to 8. Let the sum of the elements in the first group be \(S_1\) and the sum of the elements in the second group be \(S_2\). Then \(S_1 + S_2 = 8\). We want to minimize \(S_1^2 + S_2^2\). Using the identity \(S_1^2 + S_2^2 = S_1^2 + (8 - S_1)^2\), we get:

\[
S_1^2 + (8 - S_1)^2 = S_1^2 + 64 - 16S_1 + S_1^2 = 2S_1^2 - 16S_1 + 64 = 2(S_1^2 - 8S_1 + 32) = 2((S_1 - 4)^2 + 16) = 2(S_1 - 4)^2 + 32.
\]

The expression \(2(S_1 - 4)^2 + 32\) is minimized when \((S_1 - 4)^2\) is minimized. The minimum value of \((S_1 - 4)^2\) is 0, but since \(S_1\) must be the sum of integers from the set \(\{-7, -5, -3, -2, 2, 4, 6, 13\}\) and the set does not include 4, \(S_1\) cannot be exactly 4. The next possible values for \(S_1\) are 2 and 6, which give \((S_1 - 4)^2 = 4\).

Substituting \((S_1 - 4)^2 = 4\) into the expression, we get:

\[
2(4) + 32 = 8 + 32 = 40.
\]
