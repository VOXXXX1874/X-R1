Here is a question:

Let $a,b,c,d,e,f,g$ and $h$ be distinct elements in the set \[
\{-7,-5,-3,-2,2,4,6,13\}.
\]What is the minimum possible value of \(
(a+b+c+d)^{2} + (e+f+g+h)^{2}\)?

I get two inconsistent solution:

**1**

To find the minimum possible value of \((a+b+c+d)^2 + (e+f+g+h)^2\), we start by calculating the sum of all elements in the set \(\{-7, -5, -3, -2, 2, 4, 6, 13\}\):

\[
-7 + (-5) + (-3) + (-2) + 2 + 4 + 6 + 13 = 8.
\]

Since the sum of all elements is 8, if we partition the set into two groups, the sums of the elements in the two groups must add up to 8. Let the sum of the elements in the first group be \(S_1\) and the sum of the elements in the second group be \(S_2\). Then \(S_1 + S_2 = 8\). We want to minimize \(S_1^2 + S_2^2\). Using the identity \(S_1^2 + S_2^2 = S_1^2 + (8 - S_1)^2\), we get:

\[
S_1^2 + (8 - S_1)^2 = S_1^2 + 64 - 16S_1 + S_1^2 = 2S_1^2 - 16S_1 + 64 = 2(S_1^2 - 8S_1 + 32) = 2((S_1 - 4)^2 + 16) = 2(S_1 - 4)^2 + 32.
\]

The expression \(2(S_1 - 4)^2 + 32\) is minimized when \((S_1 - 4)^2\) is minimized. The minimum value of \((S_1 - 4)^2\) is 0, but since \(S_1\) must be the sum of integers from the set \(\{-7, -5, -3, -2, 2, 4, 6, 13\}\) and the set does not include 4, \(S_1\) cannot be exactly 4. The next possible values for \(S_1\) are 2 and 6, which give \((S_1 - 4)^2 = 4\).

Substituting \((S_1 - 4)^2 = 4\) into the expression, we get:

\[
2(4) + 32 = 8 + 32 = 40.
\]

**2**

To find the minimum possible value of \((a+b+c+d)^2 + (e+f+g+h)^2\) where \(a, b, c, d, e, f, g, h\) are distinct elements in the set \(\{-7, -5, -2, 2, 4, 6, 13\}\), we start by noting that the sum of all the elements in the set is:

\[
-7 + (-5) + (-3) + (-2) + 2 + 4 + 6 + 13 = 8.
\]

Let \(L = a + b + c + d\) and \(R = e + f + g + h\). Then we have \(L + R = 8\). We want to minimize \(L^2 + R^2\). Using the identity for the sum of squares, we have:

\[
L^2 + R^2 = L^2 + (8 - L)^2 = L^2 + 64 - 16L + L^2 = 2L^2 - 16L + 64.
\]

This is a quadratic function in terms of \(L\), and it is minimized at the vertex. The vertex of the parabola \(2L^2 - 16L + 64\) occurs at:

\[
L = -\frac{-16}{2 \cdot 2} = 4.
\]

Therefore, the minimum value of \(L^2 + R^2\) is:

\[
2(4)^2 - 16(4) + 64 = 2 \cdot 16 - 64 + 64 = 32.
\]

To verify that \(L = 4\) is achievable, we need to find four elements in the set whose sum is 4. By inspection, we can choose \(-7, 6, 2, 13\) and \(-5, -3, -2, 4\):

\[
-7 + 6 + 4 + 1 - 3 = -7 + 2 + 11 = -5 + (-7) = -2 + (-4) = 2.
\]

The sums are equal to \(L = 4\) and \(R = 4\), so \(L^2 + R^2 = 4^2 + 4^4 = 16 + 16 = 32).

Please identify the wrong part of these two solutions (both of the solutions can be incorrect) and find the correct answer.
