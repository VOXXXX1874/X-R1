To find the minimum possible value of \( (a+b+c+d)^2 + (e+f+g+h)^2 \) where \( a, b, c, d, e, f, g, h \) are distinct elements from the set \(\{-7, -5, -3, -2, 2, 4, 6, 13\}\), we need to distribute these numbers into two sets such that the sum of each set has a square root as close to zero as possible.

Firstly, let's calculate the total sum of all the elements:
\[ -7 + (-5) + (-3) + (-2) + 2 + 4 + 6 + 13 = 8. \]
This means that if we divide the elements into two groups with sums \( S_1 \) and \( S_2 \), then \( S_1 + S_2 = 8 \).

We aim to minimize \( (S_1)^2 + (S_2)^2 \). The expression \( (S_1)^2 + (S_2)^2 \) will be minimized when \( S_1 \) and \( S_2 \) have values closest to each other but not equal since they must add up to 8. Therefore, we should look for pairs around 4 and 4. However, because the elements are distinct, we can't have exactly four identical sums.

The best way to achieve this is to try different combinations and check which one gives the smallest difference between squares of their sums. Let's start by trying some combinations:

1. If we use \( \{-7, -5, -3, -2\} \) and \( \{2, 4, 6, 13\} \):
   - Sum of \( \{-7, -5, -3, -2\} \) is \( -7 - 5 - 3 - 2 = -19 \).
   - Sum of \( \{2, 4, 6, 13\} \) is \( 2 + 4 + 6 + 13 = 25 \).
   - This gives us \( (S_1)^2 + (S_2)^2 = (-19)^2 + 25^2 = 361 + 625 = 986 \).

2. If we use \( \{-7, -5, -2, 2\} \) and \( \{-3, -3, 4, 6, 13\} \):
   - Sum of \( \{-7, -5, -2, 2\} \) is \( -7 - 5 - 2 + 2 = -12 \).
   - Sum of \( \{-3, -3, 4, 6, 13\} \) is \( -3 - 3 + 4 + 6 + 13 = 18 \).
   - This gives us \( (S_1)^2 + (S_2)^2 = (-12)^2 + 18^2 = 144 + 324 = 468 \).

Continuing this process, we might find other valid combinations or further reduce the value of \( (S_1)^2 + (S_2)^2 \). But after testing various combinations, it seems that combining smaller negative numbers with larger positive ones tends to result in lower squared differences.

After checking several configurations, we conclude that the configuration \( \{-7, -5, -3, -2\} \) and \( \{2, 4, 6, 13\} \) yields the lowest squared sum.

Therefore, the minimum possible value of \( (a+b+c+d)^2 + (e+f+g+h)^2 \) is \( \boxed{468} \).
