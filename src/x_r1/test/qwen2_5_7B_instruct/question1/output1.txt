To find the minimum possible value of \((a+b+c+d)^2 + (e+f+g+h)^2\) where \(a, b, c, d, e, f, g, h\) are distinct elements from the set \(\{-7, -5, -3, -2, 2, 4, 6, 13\}\), we need to balance the sums of two subsets as closely as possible.

First, let's calculate the sum of all elements in the set:
\[
-7 + (-5) + (-3) + (-2) + 2 + 4 + 6 + 13 = 8.
\]
We want to split these elements into two subsets such that the sums of the elements in each subset are as close as possible. Let \(S_1 = a + b + c + d\) and \(S_2 = e + f + g + h\). Then \(S_1 + S_2 = 8\).

To minimize \((S_1)^2 + (S_2)^2\), we should have \(S_1\) and \(S_2\) as close to each other as possible. The closest values for \(S_1\) and \(S_2\) are 4 and 4, but since the total sum is 8 and we have an even number of elements, it is possible to achieve this balance.

Now, we need to find a way to split the set into two subsets with sums of 4 each. Let's try different combinations:

1. If we include 13 in one subset, the sum of the remaining elements must be \(8 - 13 = -5\). This is not possible because the smallest sum of any four elements from the remaining set is \(-7 + (-5) + (-3) + (-2) = -17\).
2. If we include 6 in one subset, the sum of the remaining elements must be \(8 - 6 = 2\). We can check if we can get a sum of 2 with the remaining elements: \(-7 + (-5) + 2 + 4 = -6\), which is not 2.
3. If we include 4 in one subset, the sum of the remaining elements must be \(8 - 4 = 4\). We can check if we can get a sum of 4 with the remaining elements: \(-7 + (-5) + (-3) + 13 = 8\) and \(-2 + 2 + 6 = 6\), which does not work.
4. If we include 2 in one subset, the sum of the remaining elements must be \(8 - 2 = 6\). We can check if we can get a sum of 2 with the remaining elements: \(-7 + (-5) + (-3) + 2 = -13\), which is not 2.
5. If we include -2 in one subset, the sum of the remaining elements must be \(8 - (-2) = 10\). We can check if we can get a sum of 2 with the remaining elements: \(-7 + (-5) + (-3) + 2 = -13\), which is not 2.
6. If we include -3 in one subset, the sum of the remaining elements must be \(8 - (-3) = 11\). We can check if we can get a sum of 2 with the remaining elements: \(-7 + (-5) + (-2) + 2 = -12\), which is not 2.
7. If we include -5 in one subset, the sum of the remaining elements must be \(8 - (-5) = 13\). We can check if we can get a sum of 2 with the remaining elements: \(-7 + (-3) + 2 + 6 = 2\), which works.

So, one possible partition is \(\{ -7, -3, 2, 6 \}\) and \(\{ -5, -2, 4, 13 \}\). Both subsets sum to 4:
\[
-7 + (-3) + 2 + 6 = 4,
\]
\[
-5 + (-2) + 4 + 13 = 4.
\]

Thus, the value of \((a+b+c+d)^2 + (e+f+g+h)^2\) is:
\[
4^2 + 4^2 = 16 + 16 = 32.
\]

Therefore, the minimum possible value is \(\boxed{32}\).
