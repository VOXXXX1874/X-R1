To find the minimum possible value of \((a+b+c+d)^2 + (e+f+g+h)^2\), where \(a, b, c, d, e, f, g, h\) are distinct elements from the set \(\{-7, -5, -3, -2, 2, 4, 6, 13\}\), we need to minimize the expression by ensuring that the sums of the two groups are as close to zero as possible.

First, let's calculate the total sum of the elements in the set:
\[
-7 + (-5) + (-3) + (-2) + 2 + 4 + 6 + 13 = 8
\]
Since the total sum is 8, if we can split the set into two groups of four elements each, with the sums of the elements in each group being as close to 4 as possible, we can minimize the expression \((a+b+c+d)^2 + (e+f+g+h)^2\).

Let's try to find such a split. We need to find two subsets of four elements each such that the sums of the elements in each subset are as close as possible to 4. We can start by testing some possible splits:

1. Split 1: \(\{-7, 6, 4, 1\}\)
   \[
   -7 + 6 + 4 + 1 = 4
   \]
   The other split will be \(\{-5, -3, -2, 13\}\):
   \[
   -5 + (-3) + (-2) + 13 = 3
   \]
   The value of the expression is:
   \[
   4^2 + 3^2 = 16 + 9 = 25
   \]

2. Split 2: \(\{-7, 6, 3, 2\}\)
   \[
   -7 + 6 + 3 + 2 = 4
   \]
   The other split will be \(\{-5, -3, -2, 13\}\):
   \[
   -5 + (-3) + (-2) + 13 = 3
   \]
   The value of the expression is:
   \[
   4^2 + 3^2 = 16 + 9 = 25
   \]

3. Split 3: \(\{-7, 6, 4, 1\}\)
   \[
   -7 + 6 + 4 + 1 = 4
   \]
   The other split will be \(\{-5, -3, -2, 13\}\):
   \[
   -5 + (-3) + (-2) + 13 = 3
   \]
   The value of the expression is:
   \[
   4^2 + 3^2 = 16 + 9 = 25
   \]

We can see that the value of the expression is consistently 25 for these splits. To confirm that 25 is indeed the minimum, we can consider other possible splits, but it is unlikely to find a split that results in a smaller value because the sums of the elements in the sets must add up to 8, and the closest we can get to splitting this sum equally between two groups of four elements is by having sums of 4 and 3, which results in the value 25 for the expression.

Thus, the minimum possible value of \((a+b+c+d)^2 + (e+f+g+h)^2\) is \(\boxed{25}\).
