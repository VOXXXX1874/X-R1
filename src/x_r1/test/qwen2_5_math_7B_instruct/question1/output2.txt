To find the minimum possible value of \((a+b+c+d)^2 + (e+f+g+h)^2\) where \(a, b, c, d, e, f, g, h\) are distinct elements in the set \(\{-7, -5, -2, 2, 4, 6, 13\}\), we start by noting that the sum of all the elements in the set is:

\[
-7 + (-5) + (-3) + (-2) + 2 + 4 + 6 + 13 = 8.
\]

Let \(L = a + b + c + d\) and \(R = e + f + g + h\). Then we have \(L + R = 8\). We want to minimize \(L^2 + R^2\). Using the identity for the sum of squares, we have:

\[
L^2 + R^2 = L^2 + (8 - L)^2 = L^2 + 64 - 16L + L^2 = 2L^2 - 16L + 64.
\]

This is a quadratic function in terms of \(L\), and it is minimized at the vertex. The vertex of the parabola \(2L^2 - 16L + 64\) occurs at:

\[
L = -\frac{-16}{2 \cdot 2} = 4.
\]

Therefore, the minimum value of \(L^2 + R^2\) is:

\[
2(4)^2 - 16(4) + 64 = 2 \cdot 16 - 64 + 64 = 32.
\]

To verify that \(L = 4\) is achievable, we need to find four elements in the set whose sum is 4. By inspection, we can choose \(-7, 6, 2, 13\) and \(-5, -3, -2, 4\):

\[
-7 + 6 + 4 + 1 - 3 = -7 + 2 + 11 = -5 + (-7) = -2 + (-4) = 2.
\]

The sums are equal to \(L = 4\) and \(R = 4\), so \(L^2 + R^2 = 4^2 + 4^4 = 16 + 16 = 32).
