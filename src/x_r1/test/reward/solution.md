Let's factor \(x^8 - 1\) using the difference of squares repeatedly. First, notice that \(x^8 - 1\) can be written as a difference of squares:</>
\[
x^8 - 1 = (x^4 - 1)(x^4 + 1)
\]

Next, factor \(x^4 - 1\) further using the difference of squares:</>
\[
x^4 - 1 = (x^2 - 1)(x^2 + 1)
\]
\[
x^2 - 1 = (x - 1)(x + 1)
\]
So,
\[
x^4 - 1 = (x - 1)(x + 1)(x^2 + 1)
\]

Now, we need to factor \(x^4 + 1\). Notice that \(x^4 + 1\) can be factored using complex numbers. Recall that \(x^4 + 1 = \frac{x^8 - 1}{x^4 - 1}\). Let's factor \(x^8 - 1\) and \(x^4 - 1\) further:</>
\[
x^8 - 1 = (x^4 - 1)(x^4 + 1) = (x^2 - 1)(x^2 + 1)(x^4 + 1) = (x - 1)(x + 1)(x^2 + 1)(x^4 + 1)
\]

Thus, \(x^4 + 1\) can be written as:</>
\[
x^4 + 1 = \frac{x^8 - 1}{x^4 - 1} = \frac{(x^2 - 1)(x^2 + 1)(x^4 + 1)}{x^4 - 1} = \frac{(x - 1)(x + 1)(x^2 + 1)(x^4 + 1)}{x^2 - 1}
\]

Now, we have:</>
\[
x^8 - 1 = (x - 1)(x + 1)(x^2 + 1)(x^4 + 1)
\]

We need to check if any of these factors can be further factored. The factors \(x^2 + 1\) and \(x^4 + 1\) are irreducible over the reals, so we cannot factor them further. Therefore, the factors \(p_i(x)\) are:</>
\[
p_1(x) = (x - 1), \quad p_2(x) = (x + 1), \quad p_3(x) = x^2 + 1, \quad p_4(x) = x^4 + 1
\]

Thus, the largest possible value of \(k\) is \(4\).
