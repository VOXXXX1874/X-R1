To find the smallest positive integer that is a multiple of 30 using only the digits 0 and 2, we need to understand the properties of numbers divisible by 30. A number is divisible by 30 if it is divisible by both 2 (which means it ends in an even digit) and 15 (since 30 = 2 × 3 × 5). Since we are restricted to the digits 0 and 2, let's break this down step-by-step.

### Step 1: Divisibility by 2
For a number to be divisible by 2, its last digit must be one of {0, 2}. Given our restriction to digits 0 and 2, the possible ending digits for our number are either 0 or 2.

### Step 2: Divisibility by 5
A number is divisible by 5 if its last digit is 0 or 5. However, since we cannot use 5, the only possibility here is that the number ends in 0.

So far, the possibilities based on divisibility rules so far are:
- Endings could be: 0 (divisible by 10).

However, as we know, there are no digits 9 and other non-ending options.

### Step 3: Combining Both Conditions
Since the number must end in 0 to satisfy the condition for being divisible by 2 (and also ensuring it’s divisible by 5), we look for multiples of 30 composed exclusively of the digits 0 and 2.

The smallest such number would start with the first available non-zero digit which satisfies all conditions - starting from 2 (as 2 itself is divisible by 2 and does not conflict with any other divisibility rules needed).

Thus, considering the sequence of these two requirements together:

The number formed starts with 2, followed by zeros and then ending in zero due to divisibility constraints. The minimal form meeting all criteria without additional steps or further extensions is **2**.

Hence, the smallest positive integer multiple of 30 composed entirely of the digits 0 and 2 is:
\[ \boxed{2} \]
